# Lesson 04 : Negative Factual Information Questions

## Question in Homework 03

!!! Question

	Pheromones are substances that serve as chemical signals between members of the same species. They are secreted to the outside of the body and cause other individuals of the species to have specific reactions. Pheromones, which are sometimes called "social hormones," affect a group of individuals somewhat like hormones do an individual animal. Pheromones are the predominant medium of communication among insects (but rarely the sole method). Some species have simple pheromone systems and produce only a few pheromones, but others produce many with various functions. Pheromone systems are the most complex in some of the gregarious insects.
	
	Chemical communication differs from that by sight or sound in several ways. Transmission is relatively slow (the chemical signals are usually airborne), but the signal can be persistent, depending upon the volatility of the chemical, and is sometimes effective over a very long range. Localization of the signal is generally poorer than localization of a sound or visual stimulus and is usually effected by the animal's moving upwind in response to the stimulus. The ability to modulate a chemical signal is limited, compared with communication by visual or acoustic means, but some pheromones may convey different meanings and consequently result in different behavioral or physiological responses, depending on their concentration or when presented in combination. The modulation of chemical signals occurs via the elaboration of the number of exocrine glands that produce pheromones. Some species, such as ants, seem to be very articulate creatures, but their medium of communication is difficult for humans to study and appreciate because of our own olfactory insensitivity and the technological difficulties in detecting and analyzing these pheromones.
	
	Pheromones play numerous roles in the activities of insects. They may act as alarm substances, play a role in individual and group recognition, serve as attractants between sexes, mediate the formation of aggregations, identify foraging trails, and be involved in caste determination. For example, pheromones involved in caste determination include the "queen substance" produced by queen honey bees. Aphids, which are particularly vulnerable to predators because of their gregarious habits and sedentary nature, secrete an alarm pheromone when attacked that causes nearby aphids to respond by moving away.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- (1) The speed at which communication through pheromones occurs is dependent on how quickly they ____.
			- A）lose their effectiveness  
			- B）evaporate in the air  
			- C）travel through the air  
			- D）are produced by the body
		
		- (2) According to the passage, the meaning of a message communicated through a pheromone may vary when the ____.
			- A）chemical structure of the pheromone is changed  
			- B）pheromone is fused with other pheromones  
			- C）exocrine glands do not produce the pheromone 
			- D）pheromone is released near certain specific organisms
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		- (1) C）travel through the air 
		
			根据原文 "Transmission is relatively slow (the chemical signals are usually airborne), but the signal can be persistent, depending upon the volatility of the chemical"，可以得知化学信号是通过空气传播的，所以可以对应选项 C）
		
		- (2) B）pheromone is fused with other pheromones
		
			根据原文 "some pheromones may convey different meanings and consequently result in different behavioral or physiological responses, depending on their concentration or when presented in combination." 可以得知取决于它们的浓度或者当不同信息素结合在一起时，对应 B）选项

!!! example "Example 01"

	Agriculture rendered possible a more stable and secure life. With it Neolithic peoples fourished, fashioning an energetic, creative era. They were responsible for many ingenious tools that the modern world takes for granted. First, apparently, is systematic agriculture-that is, the reliance of Neolithic peoples on agriculture as their primary, not merely subsidiary, source of food. Thus they developed the primary economic activity of the entire ancient world and the basis of all modern life. With the sedentary routine of Neolithic farmers came the evolution of towns and eventually cities. Neolithic farmers usually raised more food than they could consume, and their surpluses permitted larger, healthier populations. Population growth in turn created an even greater reliance on settled farming, as only systematic agriculture could sustain the increased numbers of people. Since surpluses of food could also be bartered for other commodities, the Neolithic era witnessed the beginnings of large-scale exchange of goods.

	=== "Question"
	
		- The author mentions all of the following as outcomes of the shift to agricultural societies EXCEPT
			- A) a surge in inventions
			- B) emergence of urban areas
			- C) development of trade
			- D) a decline in warfare
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		D) a decline in warfare
	
		A）在原文 "They were responsible for many ingenious tools that the modern world takes for granted." 可以对应。
		
		B）在原文 "With the sedentary routine of Neolithic farmers came the evolution of towns and eventually cities." 可以对应。
		
		C）在原文 "Since surpluses of food could also be bartered for other commodities, the Neolithic era witnessed the beginnings of large-scale exchange of goods." 可以对应。

# Lesson 04 : Negative Factual Information Questions

## Question in Homework 03

!!! Question

	Pheromones are substances that serve as chemical signals between members of the same species. They are secreted to the outside of the body and cause other individuals of the species to have specific reactions. Pheromones, which are sometimes called "social hormones," affect a group of individuals somewhat like hormones do an individual animal. Pheromones are the predominant medium of communication among insects (but rarely the sole method). Some species have simple pheromone systems and produce only a few pheromones, but others produce many with various functions. Pheromone systems are the most complex in some of the gregarious insects.
	
	Chemical communication differs from that by sight or sound in several ways. Transmission is relatively slow (the chemical signals are usually airborne), but the signal can be persistent, depending upon the volatility of the chemical, and is sometimes effective over a very long range. Localization of the signal is generally poorer than localization of a sound or visual stimulus and is usually effected by the animal's moving upwind in response to the stimulus. The ability to modulate a chemical signal is limited, compared with communication by visual or acoustic means, but some pheromones may convey different meanings and consequently result in different behavioral or physiological responses, depending on their concentration or when presented in combination. The modulation of chemical signals occurs via the elaboration of the number of exocrine glands that produce pheromones. Some species, such as ants, seem to be very articulate creatures, but their medium of communication is difficult for humans to study and appreciate because of our own olfactory insensitivity and the technological difficulties in detecting and analyzing these pheromones.
	
	Pheromones play numerous roles in the activities of insects. They may act as alarm substances, play a role in individual and group recognition, serve as attractants between sexes, mediate the formation of aggregations, identify foraging trails, and be involved in caste determination. For example, pheromones involved in caste determination include the "queen substance" produced by queen honey bees. Aphids, which are particularly vulnerable to predators because of their gregarious habits and sedentary nature, secrete an alarm pheromone when attacked that causes nearby aphids to respond by moving away.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- (1) The speed at which communication through pheromones occurs is dependent on how quickly they ____.
			- A）lose their effectiveness  
			- B）evaporate in the air  
			- C）travel through the air  
			- D）are produced by the body
		
		- (2) According to the passage, the meaning of a message communicated through a pheromone may vary when the ____.
			- A）chemical structure of the pheromone is changed  
			- B）pheromone is fused with other pheromones  
			- C）exocrine glands do not produce the pheromone 
			- D）pheromone is released near certain specific organisms
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		- (1) C）travel through the air 
		
			根据原文 "Transmission is relatively slow (the chemical signals are usually airborne), but the signal can be persistent, depending upon the volatility of the chemical"，可以得知化学信号是通过空气传播的，所以可以对应选项 C）
		
		- (2) B）pheromone is fused with other pheromones
		
			根据原文 "some pheromones may convey different meanings and consequently result in different behavioral or physiological responses, depending on their concentration or when presented in combination." 可以得知取决于它们的浓度或者当不同信息素结合在一起时，对应 B）选项

	Agriculture rendered possible a more stable and secure life. With it Neolithic peoples fourished, fashioning an energetic, creative era. They were responsible for many ingenious tools that the modern world takes for granted. First, apparently, is systematic agriculture-that is, the reliance of Neolithic peoples on agriculture as their primary, not merely subsidiary, source of food. Thus they developed the primary economic activity of the entire ancient world and the basis of all modern life. With the sedentary routine of Neolithic farmers came the evolution of towns and eventually cities. Neolithic farmers usually raised more food than they could consume, and their surpluses permitted larger, healthier populations. Population growth in turn created an even greater reliance on settled farming, as only systematic agriculture could sustain the increased numbers of people. Since surpluses of food could also be bartered for other commodities, the Neolithic era witnessed the beginnings of large-scale exchange of goods. In time the increasing sophistication of Neolithic societies contributed to the evolution of writing, prompted by the necessity for documentation and later by the craving to chronicle experiences, learning, and beliefs.

	=== "Question"
	
		- (1) The author mentions all of the following as outcomes of the shift to agricultural societies EXCEPT
			- A) a surge in inventions
			- B) emergence of urban areas
			- C) development of trade
			- D) a decline in warfare
		
		- (2) According to the passage, all of the following led to the development of writing EXCEPT the 
			- A) need to keep records
			- B) urge to preserve wisdom
			- C) promotion of aesthetic values
			- D) growth of social complexity
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		- (1) D) a decline in warfare
	
			A）在原文 "They were responsible for many ingenious tools that the modern world takes for granted." 可以对应。
			
			B）在原文 "With the sedentary routine of Neolithic farmers came the evolution of towns and eventually cities." 可以对应。
			
			C）在原文 "Since surpluses of food could also be bartered for other commodities, the Neolithic era witnessed the beginnings of large-scale exchange of goods." 可以对应。
		
		- (2) C) promotion of aesthetic values
		
			根据原文 "necessity for documentation" 对应 A)，"craving to chronicle experiences, learning, and beliefs" 对应 B)，"the increasing sophistication of Neolithic societies" 对应 D)

	Archaeological discoveries have led some scholars to believe that the first Mesopotamian inventors of writing may have been a people the later Babylonians called Subarians. According to tradition, they came from the north and moved into Uruk in the south. By about 3100 B.C, they were apparently subjugated in southern Mesopotamia by the Sumerians, whose name became synonymous with the region immediately north of the Persian Gulf, in the fecund lower valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, Here the Sumerians were already well established by the year 3000 B.C. They had invented bronze, an alloy that could be cast in molds, out of which they made tools and weapons. They lived in cities, and they had begun to acquire and use capital. Perhaps most important, the Sumerians adapted writing(probably from the Subarians) into a flexible tool of communication.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- By about 3000 B.C. the Sumerians had already done all of the following EXCEPT:
			- A) they had abandoned the area north of the Persian Gulf
			- B) they had settled in cities
			- C) they had started to communicate through writing
			- D) they had created bronze tools and weapons
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		A) they had abandoned the area north of the Persian Gulf.
		
		该选项很明显和原文 "By about 3100 B.C, they were apparently subjugated in southern Mesopotamia by the Sumerians, whose name became synonymous with the region immediately north of the Persian Gulf" 不符。

	The United States in the 1800's was teeming with practical,industrious people who reckoned the arts from theater to painting as trivial occupations. In addition, the public's attitude that European art surpassed American art both disheartened and infuriated American artists. In the early 1900's there was an intense feeling among artists that the United States was long overdue in developing art that did not reproduce European traditions. Everybody agreed that the heart and soul of the new country should be reflected in its art. But opinions differed about what this art would be like and how it would develop.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- All of the following are true of American art in the late 1800s and early 1900s EXCEPT:
			- A) most Americans deemed art as minor
			- B) American art generally replicated European styles and traditions
			- C) most Americans perceived American art inferior to European art
			- D) American art was the essence of the United states
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		D) American art was the essence of the United states
		
		原文为 "Everybody agreed that the heart and soul of the new country should be reflected in its art." 这里的 `should` 和 D 选项的 `was` 不对应。

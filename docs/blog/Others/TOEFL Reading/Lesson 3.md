	=== "Question"
	
		From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the use of outlines and perspectives to delineate the arrangement of objects and other surfaces in space. But pictures are more than literal representations. This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a curve inside. I was taken aback. Lines of motion, such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle notes, Wilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonists, used virtually no motion lines in his popular figures until about 1877.
		
		- （1）This paragraph makes the point that blind people
			- A）may find art very intriguing
			- B）can sketch the contours of objects and surfaces
			- C）can recognize conventional drawing techniques
			- D）are able to produce a picture accurately
		
		- （2）The writer was very surprised when the blind woman
			- A）drew a circle on her own initiative 
			- B）exhibited her expertise in illustration
			- C）employed a symbol representing movement
			- D）was the first person to use lines of motion
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		- （1）C）can recognize conventional drawing techniques
		
			根据原文 appreciate the use of... 即可同义转换为 C 选项
		
		- （2）C）employed a symbol representing movement
		
			原文中 "I was taken aback" 与题目中 "surprise" 相同，根据上下文可确定为 C 选项

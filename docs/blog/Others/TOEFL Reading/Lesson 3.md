!!! question "Question 01"

	In a typical business conference, associates meet to discuss policy or to solve problems. The average participants do not do much specific preparing; their background and thinking usually formulate their contribution. But it is best if all participants know in advance the purpose of the conference. <font color="red">Some general preparation may be in order, and participants may want to take into the conference materials or data that might be instrumental if a matter comes up.  </font>
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- A）Although participants cannot be anticipated to do much, they should make some preparation. 
		- B）The conference leader should prepare all of the materials and data that will be used in the conference. 
		- C）There is a general order to most conferences, with participants contributing ideas and information.  
	    - D）As routine preparation, participants can bring materials or data that might be part of a discussion.
	
	=== "Answer"

	From a number of recent studies, it has become clear that blind people can appreciate the use of outlines and perspectives to delineate the arrangement of objects and other surfaces in space. But pictures are more than literal representations. This fact was drawn to my attention dramatically when a blind woman in one of my investigations decided on her own initiative to draw a wheel as it was spinning. To show this motion, she traced a curve inside. I was taken aback. Lines of motion, such as the one she used, are a very recent invention in the history of illustration. Indeed, as art scholar David Kunzle notes, Wilhelm Busch, a trend-setting nineteenth-century cartoonists, used virtually no motion lines in his popular figures until about 1877.
	
	=== "Question"
		
		- （1）This paragraph makes the point that blind people
			- A）may find art very intriguing
			- B）can sketch the contours of objects and surfaces
			- C）can recognize conventional drawing techniques
			- D）are able to produce a picture accurately
		
		- （2）The writer was very surprised when the blind woman
			- A）drew a circle on her own initiative 
			- B）exhibited her expertise in illustration
			- C）employed a symbol representing movement
			- D）was the first person to use lines of motion
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		- （1）C）can recognize conventional drawing techniques
		
			根据原文 appreciate the use of... 即可同义转换为 C 选项
		
		- （2）C）employed a symbol representing movement
		
			原文中 "I was taken aback" 与题目中 "surprise" 相同，根据上下文可确定为 C 选项

	The range of natural colors was hugely expanded and, indeed, superseded by the chemical dyes developed during the 1800s. By 1900 a full spectrum of synthetic colors had been evolved, many of them reaching a standard of resistance to fading from exposure to light and to washing that tremendously exceeded that of natural dyestuffs. Since then,the petroleum industry has added many new chemicals, and from these other types of dyestuffs have been developed. Much of the research in dyes was stimulated by the peculiarities of some of the new synthetic fibers--Acetate rayon, for example, seemed at first to have no affinity for dyes and a new range of dyes had to be developed; nylon and Tervlene presented similar problems.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- According to the passage, how did chemical dyes compare to natural dyes?
			- A）They had less attractive colors.
			- B）They were less easy to use.
			- C）They lost their brightness more quickly when exposed to light.
			- D）They held up better.
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		- D）They held up better.
		
		根据原文 "reaching a standard of resistance to fading from exposure to light and to washing that tremendously exceeded that of natural dyestuffs" 可以得知与 D 相同。

!!! example "Example 01"

	It should be obvious that cetaceans -- whales, porpoises, and dolphins -- are viviparous. They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young.Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke and blowhole cannot disguise their affinities with terrestrial mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is challenging to envision what the first whales looked like.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- Which of the following can be inferred about early sea otters?
			- A) Their appearance is not hard to visualize.
			- B) They were massive in size.
			- C) They lived only in aquatic environments.
			- D) They did not leave many fossil remains.
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		A) Their appearance is not hard to visualize.
		
		根据原文 "Unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds, it is challenging to envision what the first whales looked like." 说明对于 sea otters 是很好想象的。（逆向思维）

	Accustomed though we are to speaking of the films made before 1927 as "silent", the film has never been silent as such. From the very beginning, music was deemed an indispensable accompaniment; when the Lumiere films were shown at the first public film exhibition in the United States in February 1896, they were accompanied by piano improvisations on popular tunes. At first, the music played had little bearing on the films; an accompaniment of any kind would suffice. Within a very brief time, however, the incongruity of playing lively music to a solemn film became pronounced, and film pianists began to take some care in matching their pieces to the mood of the film.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- What can be inferred about the majority of films made after 1927?
			- A) They were truly “silent."
			- B) They were accompanied by symphonic orchestras.
			- C) They incorporated vocal sounds.
			- D) They corresponded to specific musical compositions.
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		C) They incorporated vocal sounds.
		
		文章一直提及 music 这个词，可以得知 1927 之前已经有了音乐，可以推断 1927 之后加入人声配音。

	The story of the westward movement of population in the United States is, in the main, the story of the expansion of American griculture, of the development of new areas for the raising of livestock and the cultivation of wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton.After 1815 improved transportation enabled more and more western farmers to break free from a self-sustaining way of life and tap into the national market economy. During periods when commodity prices were high, the rate of westward migration increased spectacularly. "Old America seemed to be breaking up and moving westward," observed an English visitor in 1817, during the first great wave of migration.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- What can be inferred from the passage about western farmers prior to 1815?
			- A) They confined their crop production to wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton.
			- B) They were able to sell their produce at steep prices.
			- C) They were not successful in tending cattle.
			- D) They practiced subsistence farming.
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		D) They practiced subsistence farming.
		
		从原文 "self-sustaining way" 可以推断出 D)

	Samuel Henry Kress, the founder of the chain, opened his first five-and-dime in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1896 and quickly expanded to other locations. One of the things that, from the very beginning, set his stores apart from the competition was his use of high-quality, aesthetically appealing materials in their construction. Everything was meticulously implemented to draw customers in and encourage them to linger in the store. Display windows of curved glass gave way to ornamental interiors of marble, fine woods, and brightly lit chandeliers. This exquisite setting was then filled with an enormous selection of products, from clothing to groceries to various other household goods.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- It can be inferred that most owners of discount stores around 1900
			- A) stocked the same fundamental inventory of products
			- B) did not concentrate as much on their stores' appearances as Kress did
			- C) provided a wide spectrum of items
			- D) decided to duplicate the success of Kress stores
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		B) did not concentrate as much on their stores' appearances as Kress did
		
		由原文 "aesthetically appealing materials in their construction" 逆向思维可知 B）

!!! example "Example 05"

	The nervous system of vertebrates is characterized by a hollow, dorsal nerve cord that ends in the head region as an enlargement, the brain. Even in its most primitive form this cord and its attached nerves are the result of evolutionary specialization, and their further evolution from lower to higher vertebrate classes is a process that is far from fully understood. Nevertheless, the basic arrangements are similar in all vertebrates, and the study of lower animals gives insight into the form and structure of the nervous system of higher animals. Moreover, for any species the study of the embryological development of the nervous system is a prerequisite for an understanding of adult morphology.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- The author implies that a careful investigation of a biological structure in an embryo may lead to
			- A) improved research into the same structure in other species
			- B) a better command of the fully developed structure
			- C) discovering ways in which poor development can be corrected
			- D) a method by which scientists can document the various stages of development
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		B) a better command of the fully developed structure
		
		原文最后一句 "is a prerequisite for an understanding of adult morphology" 和 B) 相似

	The history of clinical nutrition, or the study of the relationship between health and how the body take in and utilizes food substances, can be divided into four distinct eras: the first began in the nineteenth century and extended into the early twentieth century when it was recognized for the first time that food contained constituents that were essential for human function and that different foods provided different amounts of these essential agents. Near the end of this era, research studies demonstrated that rapid weight loss was associated with nitrogen imbalance and could only be rectified by providing adequate dietary protein associated with certain foods.
	
	=== "Question"
	
		- It can be inferred that which of the following discoveries was made during the first era in the history of nutrition?
			- A) Protein was recognized as an essential component of diet.
			- B) Vitamins were synthesized from foods.
			- C) Effective techniques of weight loss were determined.
			- D）Certain foods were found to be harmful to good health.
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		A) Protein was recognized as an essential component of diet.
		
		由原文 "it was recognized for the first time that food contained constituents" 可推断出 A)

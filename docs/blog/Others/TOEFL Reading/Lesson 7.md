# Lesson 07 : Summary Questions

## Questions in Homework 06

!!! question "Question"

	Of all modern instruments, the violin is apparently one of the simplest. [A] It consists in essence of a hollow, varnished wooden sound box, or resonator, and a long neck, covered with a fingerboard, along which four strings are stretched at high tension. [B] The beauty of design, shape, and decoration is no accident: the proportions of the instrument are determined almost entirely by acoustical considerations. [C] About 70 parts are involved in the construction of a violin. [D] Its tone and its outstanding range of expressiveness make it an ideal solo instrument. No less important, however, is its role as an orchestral and chamber instrument. In combination with the larger and deeper-sounding members of the same family, the violins form the nucleus of the modern symphony orchestra.
	
	=== "Text"
	
		Its simplicity of appearance is deceptive.
	
	=== "Answer"
	
		(C)。由后文 70 parts 说明 simplicity 是有欺骗性的，其实很复杂。

## Skills

- While reading, summarize the main idea of each paragraph. It is always advisable for you to find out the <font color="red">topic sentence</font> in each paragraph.
	- The topic sentence describes the subject of the paragraph and itsmain idea. lf you can develop a nose for locating topic sentences, you can get the main idea from paragraphs quickly and thereby improve your reading speed and comprehension.
	- Typically, the topic sentence comes first in a paragraph, and the remaining sentences elaborate on the topic sentence.
	- Sometimes the topic sentence isn't the first sentence in the paragraph. Sometimes it's buried deeper.
	- Sometimes the author may be a bit of a windbag and takes his time getting to the main idea.
	- <font color="red">Cautions!</font> In rare cases, there is no topic sentence at all; the paragraph as a whole will give us the topic.
- While getting down to the summary question, you can adopt a two-step approach: 
	- Decide whether each statement is <font color="red">true of false</font>;
	- Decide whether the information is <font color="red">major or minor</font>.
- Be sure to return to the passage to <font color="red">check out</font> your selected answers!
